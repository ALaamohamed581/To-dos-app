Design 

this app was mainly designed using figma ,"not my design"

styles used are of tailwinds and chance library 

developed using typescript and React


-the first stage  was building a completed app in one component of a working todo app
-The second stage was to devid the app  into its respective components 
-third test the app 

-during the development process, i used a mock api for to-dos that gets all to-dos (the actual to-dos) but it doesn't remove add or patch 
rather simulates the requests of(put ,patch ,add)
